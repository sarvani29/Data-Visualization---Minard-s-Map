# DataVisualization_MinardMap
Minard’s map has been reconstructed using Altair showing the following:
1.	Napoleon and his army’s march trail
2.	The cities crossed have been marked on the trail
3.	The number of survivors has been marked as well and the size of the trail becomes thinner as the number of survivors drops gradually
4.	Temperature chart is plotted as the temperature varies with the longitude
